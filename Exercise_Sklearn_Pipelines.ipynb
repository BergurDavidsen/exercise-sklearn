    "*Made by viga@itu.dk and thso@itu.dk*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll be working with the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of 11 features and a quality score for 4898 white wine samples and 1599 red wine samples. The goal is to predict the quality of the wine based on the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are located in the `data` folder. The `winequality-red.csv` file contains the red wine samples and the `winequality-white.csv` file contains the white wine samples. Lastly, the `winequality.names` file contains a description of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to get you familiar with the [Scikit-learn Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) API. You'll be using pipelines to perform feature scaling and feature selection."

    "## Load in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either load the red-wine dataset or the white-wine dataset. You can also load both datasets and combine them if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets are available in the `data` folder, and are called `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You can use the `pd.read_csv()` function to load in the data (remember to check the delimiter!). You can find the documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html).\n"
